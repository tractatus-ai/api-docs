title: "API Authentication"
description: "Authenticating your Tractatus AI API calls"
---

All endpoints authenticate the user with a Tractatus API Key provided in the request header for every API call.

```bash
'x-api-key': '<Tractatus API Key>'
```

API Keys are granted on an individual basis for now. An API "owner" should be assigned and they should use their
Tractatus API key for authentication. In the future, we may provide organization-level API keys.

You can access your API key by logging on to the Tractatus AI web application at app.tractatus.ai. Click on the
`Settings` gear icon at the bottom of the sidebar. Then click on `Billing & Usage` to view your API key. Press
the `Copy` icon to copy the API key to your clipboard.
